             </div>
             <p class="p">Hey! My name is Meer Hamza Jehangir and I am currently in my last semester of BS (Honors) in Software Engineering.

               <h3 class="st">Passion and Goals</h3>
             </div>
             <p class="p">I like creating user applications, or small algorithms and games. It's what drives me to code. Everytime I finish something, it is super satisfactory. My current goal is to get a job in Flutter developement after I finish my degree.</p>
         
     
             <div class="vl">
               <h3 class="st">Values</h3>
             </div>
             <p class="p">I hold 3 values very dear to me which is Punctuality, Transparency and a Good Documentation. Everything done on set time builds trust and good relations, Transparency is no matter what the results are, a timely honest response to your team helps you and them solve the issues without major losses. A Good Documentation of your work is proof of your commitment to your project and your team.</p>
       

       
        <div class="vl">
          <h3 class="st">Education</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="p">I am nearly done with my BS (Honors) in Software Engineering and I plan to do Masters in applied sciences in the future for a more in depth knowledge depending on the situation.</p>
    

        <div class="vl">
          <h3 class="st">Skills</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="p">I have knowledge in many languages as I like to fiddle around in my free time here and there but my main skillset for work is Flutter Framework and Dart Language. Besides this, I have done work in Java, C, C#, HTML, CSS and PHP. Why I am choosing Flutter as a main skill for work? Because I would like to ease myself into the work industry and have the actual work experience before taking on the more challenging and interesting positions.</p>
